This is not what is observed, either in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 or in those deficient in BMP2 and BMP7.An Allelic/Nonallelic Series of BMP-Deficient Limbs

Mice were generated with limbs deficient in BMP2, BMP4, or BMP7, both BMP2 and BMP4, or both BMP2 and BMP7.To obtain Bmp2C/C, Bmp7−/−; Prx1::cre we crossed Bmp2C/C, Bmp7−/+ females with Bmp2C/+, Bmp7−/+; Prx1::cre males.(E and M) Wild-type, (F and N) Bmp2C/C; Prx1::cre, (G and O) Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre, (H and P) Bmp7 −/−, (I and Q) Bmp2C/C; Bmp4+/C; Prx1::cre, (J and R) Bmp2+/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre, (K and S) Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre, (L and T) Bmp2C/C, Bmp7 −/−; Prx1::cre.Bmp2C/+; Bmp4C/+; Prx1::cre males were crossed with Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C females to generate Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre animals.All panels are from E17.5 Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre embryos.At later stages, the combined activity of neither BMP2 and BMP4 nor of BMP2 and BMP7 is required for chondrogenesis.Generation of Bmp2, Bmp4 double conditional mice and Bmp2 conditional, Bmp7 mutant mice.Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C females were crossed with males bearing Prx1::cre transgene to generate Bmp2C/+; Bmp4C/+; Prx1::cre animals.The Prx1::cre transgene has been described [32].This is not what is observed, either in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 or in those deficient in BMP2 and BMP7.An Allelic/Nonallelic Series of BMP-Deficient Limbs

Mice were generated with limbs deficient in BMP2, BMP4, or BMP7, both BMP2 and BMP4, or both BMP2 and BMP7.To obtain Bmp2C/C, Bmp7−/−; Prx1::cre we crossed Bmp2C/C, Bmp7−/+ females with Bmp2C/+, Bmp7−/+; Prx1::cre males.(E and M) Wild-type, (F and N) Bmp2C/C; Prx1::cre, (G and O) Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre, (H and P) Bmp7 −/−, (I and Q) Bmp2C/C; Bmp4+/C; Prx1::cre, (J and R) Bmp2+/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre, (K and S) Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre, (L and T) Bmp2C/C, Bmp7 −/−; Prx1::cre.Bmp2C/+; Bmp4C/+; Prx1::cre males were crossed with Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C females to generate Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre animals.All panels are from E17.5 Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre embryos.At later stages, the combined activity of neither BMP2 and BMP4 nor of BMP2 and BMP7 is required for chondrogenesis.Generation of Bmp2, Bmp4 double conditional mice and Bmp2 conditional, Bmp7 mutant mice.Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C females were crossed with males bearing Prx1::cre transgene to generate Bmp2C/+; Bmp4C/+; Prx1::cre animals.The Prx1::cre transgene has been described [32].Simultaneous removal of BMP2 and BMP7 had far less of an effect than did removal of BMP2 and BMP4 activity.Generation of Bmp2 and Bmp4 conditional null allele.The skeletal elements that formed in the absence of BMP2, BMP4, or BMP7 or BMP2 and BMP7 all underwent normal chondrogenesis and osteogenesis by a series of criteria.Compound heterozygous removal of BMP2 and BMP7 (Bmp2+/C, Bmp7+/−; Prx1::cre) and heterozygous removal of BMP2 with complete removal of BMP7 (Bmp2+/C, Bmp7−/−; Prx1::cre) were both completely wild-type in skeletal pattern and differentiation (unpublished data).Although vascularization occurs in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4, few osteoclasts are observed in the mineralized cartilage in Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre mice.This is most likely explained by compensation in the distal limb bud by BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 produced in the AER.Bmp2C/C, Bmp7−/−; Prx1::cre progeny were obtained at a rate slightly higher than 1 in 16.Animals in which both copies of Bmp2 and Bmp4 were removed (Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre) had extremely malformed limbs (Figure 1K and 1S).(A) Wild-type embryo, (B) Bmp2C/C; Bmp4C/C; Prx1::cre embryo.Third, Bmp2 and Bmp7 are on the same chromosome (Chromosome 2).Mice homozygous for removal of Bmp2 and heterozygous for Bmp7 (Bmp2C/C, Bmp7+/−; Prx1::cre) displayed the same subtle scapular defect seen in Bmp2C/C; Prx1::cre mutants alone (unpublished data).

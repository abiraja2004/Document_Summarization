AQP2-F204V Rescue in Heterozygous Mouse Collecting Ducts and in Cotransfected MDCK Cells

(A) In heterozygous animals, AQP2 localizes and responds to dDAVP normally.(B) Mutant and wild-type AQP2 physically interact.To generate GFP fusions of AQP2, the pCMV⋅SPORT6 AQP2 construct was used in a PCR reaction with the primers Sp6 and 5′-GACTGGATCCCGGCCTTGCTGCCGCGCGGCAG-3′ to remove the stop codon of AQP2.In support of this, AQP2-F204V can interact with wild-type AQP2 (Figure 5B), and when coexpressed with wild-type protein, AQP2-F204V can reach the cell surface (Figure 5C bottom right panel and 5D).In a forward genetic screen, a mouse with an Aqp2 mutation was identified.Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin, these results indicate that AQP2-F204V is transported to the cell surface when wild-type AQP2 is present, but not on its own.All exons of Aqp2 were amplified from mouse genomic DNA and sequenced.Rather, the perinuclear staining is consistent with an ER localization of mutant AQP2.

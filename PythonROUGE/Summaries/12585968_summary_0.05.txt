Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants (Fig.Targeted null Brn3c mutants have no mature hair cells [1,2].Brn3c null mutants at P7/8

Reduction of vestibular innervation is more pronounced than at P0.6 months Brn3c null mutants

Very few fibers (both afferent and efferent) to the vestibular epithelia remain (Fig.8e,8f) of the Brn3c null mutant (Fig.However, no fibers extend to the outer hair cell region in Brn3c null mutants (Figs.However, the Brn3c null mutants show only a reduced density of afferent and efferent fibers to all vestibular sensory epithelia.2c), but both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to outer hair cells in Brn3c null mutants (Fig.Not a single immature hair cell forms in the apex of the cochlea.9b) and the Brn3c null littermates (Fig.Brn3c null mutants at birth (P0)

Reduction of vestibular innervation is more pronounced than at P0.6 months Brn3c null mutants

Very few fibers (both afferent and efferent) to the vestibular epithelia remain (Fig.8e,8f) of the Brn3c null mutant (Fig.However, no fibers extend to the outer hair cell region in Brn3c null mutants (Figs.However, the Brn3c null mutants show only a reduced density of afferent and efferent fibers to all vestibular sensory epithelia.2c), but both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to outer hair cells in Brn3c null mutants (Fig.Not a single immature hair cell forms in the apex of the cochlea.9b) and the Brn3c null littermates (Fig.Brn3c null mutants at birth (P0)

The innervation of sensory epithelia is shown in 6-month old Brn3c null mutant mice.Around 20% of immature hair cells exist in the mutant vestibular sensory epithelia.[3] of only a 29% loss of spiral sensory neurons at P4, our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants (Fig.Figure 2

Innervation of Brn3c null and control ears are shown for newborn mice.The comparatively high level of NT-3 expression in Brn3c null mutant cochlea, which has been shown to be the neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral sensory neurons [6,9,14], is in agreement with the normal development of cochlear innervation in newborn Brn3c null mutants.The limited qualitative effect of Brn3c null mutations on fiber loss is particularly obvious in the P8 Brn3c null mutant apical turn (Fig.Comparison of numbers of immature hair cells in the vestibular and cochlear areas (Fig.No MyoVII positive immature hair cells exist in the apex.In contrast, only a faint signal was detected in the Brn3c null mutant (Fig.Such selective loss in Brn3c null mutants would therefore indicate reduction of a specific neurotrophin in immature hair cells.The NT-3 signal was more diffuse in both the control and the Brn3c null littermates but showed some slightly above background signal in the area of the sensory epithelium even in the Brn3c null mutant.The NT-3 signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds to the IHC's persisted at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice (Fig.

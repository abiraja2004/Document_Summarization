1997), and the (129 × C57BL/6)F2.Apcs−/− mice were generated by intercrossing Apcs−/− mice on the 129 genetic background with Apcs−/− animals backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations.Apcs levels were assessed by ELISA using sheep anti-mouse Apcs and rabbit anti-mouse Apcs Abs (Calbiochem, Nottigham, United Kingdom).Apcs−/− mouse serum was included as a negative control.The expression of anti-nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs−/− mice.Figure 6

Auto-Ab Profiles

(A) ANA titres in the (129 × C57BL/6)F2.Apcs−/− mice and (129 × C57BL/6)F2 at 1 y of age.In the C57BL/6.Apcs−/− mice, the 129 genome around the Apcs locus was mapped as a stretch of approximately 17 cM, positioned from 87.9 cM (D1Mit15) to 105 cM (D1Mit17).The Apcs−/−mice were generated as previously reported (Botto et al.Figure 8

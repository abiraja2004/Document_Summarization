Mutations in Crx represent one of a collection of gene mutations that lead to an outer segment formation defect.Figure 3

Transmission electron micrographs of Crx-/- photoreceptors in the photoreceptor layer at P7.In Crx+/+ retinas, photoreceptor inner segments, connecting cilia, and the first rudimentary outer segment structures were noted at P7.In Crx+/+ retina, numerous connecting cilia (A, cc) were evident at P7 with rudimentary outer segments.os, outer segments.(A) Photoreceptor layer of Crx+/+ retina demonstrating nascent outer segment structures (arrow) emerging from photoreceptor connecting cilia (cc).Further, in Crx-/- photoreceptors, unusually long connecting cilia were noted (Figure 4F, cc).Results

A Crx mutant strain of mice was created to serve as a model for LCA and to provide more insight into Crx's function.Vesicular structures in Crx-/- photoreceptors were observed that were similar to those previously noted in the rds/peripherin-/- mouse.At P21, abnormally long connecting cilia are noted in Crx-/- (F, cc).We found that there are many other genes that are dependent upon Crx.In addition to the complete absence of outer segments, Crx-/- retinas exhibited three other notable pathologies in the outer segment layer.In the OPL of Crx-/- retinas, photoreceptor terminals were highly disorganized at P21 (Figure 7B, arrows).(B) In the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of Crx-/- retinas, photoreceptor terminals appeared highly disorganized at P21 (arrows).Also photoreceptor terminals were perturbed in laminin beta2 mutants, but again the phenotype was more subtle then that of Crx-/- mice.(B) Crx-/- photoreceptors exhibited connecting cilia (cc) at this early stage, however, nascent outer segment structures were not observed.These data then suggest that the fact that the Crx-/- photoreceptors do not have proper synaptic endings is not due to a lack of outer segment formation.

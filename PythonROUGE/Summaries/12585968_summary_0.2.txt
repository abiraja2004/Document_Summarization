The limited expression of neurotrophins in the cochlea of Brn3c null mice suffices to support many sensory neurons, particularly in the cochlea, until birth.These data suggest that fiber organization in the outer hair cell region is partly disrupted in Brn3c null mutant.Those mutants have a much more severely reduced density of innervation in the developing cochlea [6,14] than the reduction we found in Brn3c null mutants at P0.The NT-3 expression is much more diffuse in both control and Brn3c mutant littermates.7a), thus displaying a further reduction of the pattern of innervation found in P8 Brn3c null mutants.Figure 5

Abstract

Background

Ears of Brn3c null mutants develop immature hair cells, identifiable only by certain molecular markers, and undergo apoptosis in neonates.Other than these preliminary statements, no data exists concerning the detailed pattern of loss of innervation in Brn3c null mutants.Note the prominent BDNF expression in the hair cell region (HaC) of control canal (b) and saccule (d) and low levels of expression in the Brn3c null mice (a,c) over immature hair cells (iHC).Even 6 months old mutant mice have some fibers to all vestibular sensory epithelia and many more to the cochlear apex which lacks MyoVIIa positive hair cells.There is no specific loss of all afferent and efferent innervation to the canal crista (Fig.Thus, the size reduction in the vestibular sensory ganglion could be compatible with a loss of BDNF production in the immature hair cells.Figure 6

These confocal images show the projection pattern of a P8 Brn3c null mutant mouse.Immunocytochemical and histochemcial data show the presence of only a few immature hair cells in the cochlea (Fig.No selective loss of spiral neurons is observed in Brn3c null mutants in the basal turn, a feature of either NT-3 or trkC loss [6,9,14].In control animals there is dense innervation of inner hair cells, whereas Brn3c null mutants show a curious aggregation of fibers near focal spots around the habenula perforata.Figure 8

The expression of BDNF and NT-3 mRNA is shown in the P0 vestibular sensory epithelia.Null mutants of BDNF or its receptor trkB lose all innervation to the semicircular canals and have a reduced innervation to the utricle, saccule and apical turn of the cochlea.Comparable to control mice, there is some transcellular labeling with DiI to cells apparently contacted by the afferent fibers in the Brn3c null mutant utricle (Fig.Only an occasional fiber extends beyond the inner spiral bundle into the area of the outer hair cells (Fig.This expression of NT-3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates may even preserve in Brn3c null mutants the numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of 8-day old animals (Figs.The cochlea, most prominently the apex, receives many afferent fibers, which form an interrupted inner spiral bundle (Fig.For example, all three rows of outer hair cells now receive both afferent and efferent innervation in the base of control littermates (Fig.

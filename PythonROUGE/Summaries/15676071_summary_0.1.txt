Outer segment morphogenesis in Crx-/- photoreceptors.These differences are the earliest noted differences between Crx+/+ and Crx-/- photoreceptors.(A) Evidence of ciliogenesis in the photoreceptor layer of Crx-/- retina.Finally, the morphology of the malformed Crx-/- photoreceptors was compared to rhodopsin-/- and peripherin-/- photoreceptors.The deficits in peripherin-/- and Crx-/- photoreceptor morphogenesis were found to be very similar.Figure 1

Transmission electron microscopy of the outer retina at P21 in (A) Crx+/+ and (B) Crx-/- retinas.After P7, in Crx+/+ outer segment elongation occurs.Synaptogenesis is perturbed in Crx-/- photoreceptors

The Crx-/- mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor synapses reported to date.In Crx-/- photoreceptors, few connecting cilia were observed at P7 (B, cc).Discussion

In this study, an ultrastructural analysis of Crx-/- photoreceptors was carried out.Figure 4

Transmission electron micrograph of the outer segment layer of Crx-/- retina at P21.These examples include mutations in the photoreceptor transcription factor, Crx.cofilin 1) in the Crx-/- retina, with P values of <.005.Crx-/- photoreceptors demonstrate a complete block in outer segment formation at the elongation stage.Further, Crx-/- photoreceptors demonstrated severely abnormal synaptic endings in the outer plexiform layer.(C) In the OPL of Crx-/- retinas, photoreceptor terminals appeared highly disorganized.Inner segments of Crx-/- photoreceptors exhibit numerous mitochondria (m indicated by arrow) as in Crx+/+ (Figure 1A).Figure 7

Transmission electron micrographs of the outer plexiform layer in Crx-/- retinas.Crx-/- photoreceptors had inner segments, demonstrating at least limited photoreceptor polarization in the Crx mutant, but the inner segments were extremely short (Figure 2).Figure 8

Transmission electron micrographs of the outer plexiform layer in Crx-/- retinas at P21.In this study, in order to characterize further the role of Crx in photoreceptor morphogenesis, the outer retinae from Crx-/- mice were examined using transmission electron microscopy.Generation of these Crx-/- mice has been reported elsewhere [34].Crx-/- photoreceptors cannot complete outer segment morphogenesis

Mutations in Crx represent one of a collection of gene mutations that lead to an outer segment formation defect.Figure 3

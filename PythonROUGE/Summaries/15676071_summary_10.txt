Outer segment morphogenesis in Crx-/- photoreceptors.These differences are the earliest noted differences between Crx+/+ and Crx-/- photoreceptors.(A) Evidence of ciliogenesis in the photoreceptor layer of Crx-/- retina.Finally, the morphology of the malformed Crx-/- photoreceptors was compared to rhodopsin-/- and peripherin-/- photoreceptors.The deficits in peripherin-/- and Crx-/- photoreceptor morphogenesis were found to be very similar.Figure 1

Transmission electron microscopy of the outer retina at P21 in (A) Crx+/+ and (B) Crx-/- retinas.After P7, in Crx+/+ outer segment elongation occurs.Synaptogenesis is perturbed in Crx-/- photoreceptors

The Crx-/- mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor synapses reported to date.In Crx-/- photoreceptors, few connecting cilia were observed at P7 (B, cc).Discussion

In this study, an ultrastructural analysis of Crx-/- photoreceptors was carried out.

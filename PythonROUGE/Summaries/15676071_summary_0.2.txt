Multiple pathologies in the outer segment layer in Crx-/- mice

A standard knock-out protocol was used to generate mice in which the homeodomain of Crx-/- was targeted and deleted.The Crx-/- mouse may be an excellent model for studying the pathology of this disorder, particularly the subtype of the disorder where Crx mutations are involved.Two prominent pathologies were characterized in the Crx-/- retina: (1) An absolute block in outer segment morphogenesis was noted, with the block occuring at the elongation stage of outer segment formation; (2) Crx-/- photoreceptors exhibited a severe perturbation in synapse formation.These were rarely observed in Crx+/+ and only at P14 (C, cc*).At postnatal day 21 (P21), when Crx+/+ photoreceptors exhibited robust outer segments (Figure 1A, os), Crx-/- retinas were without a recognizable outer segment layer (Figure 1B).Rhodopsin and peripherin are two photoreceptor-specific genes whose expression is significantly downregulated in the Crx-/- retinae [10,34,35].Crx mutations in LCA are varied, and include a putative dominant mutation that is proposed to encode a dominant-negative form of Crx [14,15].In Crx-/- retinae, the vast majority of photoreceptors at this stage demonstrated connecting cilia without outer segments (Figure 4D, cc).These observations indicate that in addition to inner segment formation, ciliogenesis is also largely intact in Crx-/- photoreceptors.(A) Crx+/+ rod spherules contained a single invaginating synapse with one ribbon complex.TF and EM generated, characterized and maintained the Crx-/- mouse line.Methods

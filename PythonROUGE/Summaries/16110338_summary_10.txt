All of these genes show marked derepression in the rd7 retina.Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S-cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse rd7 mutant.[19] reported that M-opsin expression is mildly increased in the rd7 mutant retina.All of the genes show marked up-regulation in the rd7 mutant.There is no change in the number of M-opsin– or Thrb2-positive cells in the rd7 mutant.The increased expression of Gckr in rd7 mutant retina suggests that it too may be a cone-enriched gene.It is possible that in the rd7 mutant retina, there is a short delay in the relocation of the M-opsin–expressing cone cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL.Figure 2

Cone and Rod Gene Expression in the rd7 Mutant at P14

The upper sets of photomicrographs demonstrate examples of type I and type II cone gene derepression in the rd7 mutant retina as explained in the main text.This gene showed a unique pattern of expression in the adult rd7 mutant retina.Novel Cone-Specific Genes Are Derepressed in rd7

Given that the majority of known cone-specific genes showed marked derepression in the rd7 mutant, additional candidate genes up-regulated on microarray analysis were evaluated for cone-specific expression.

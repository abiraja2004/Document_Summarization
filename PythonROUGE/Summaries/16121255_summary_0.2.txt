AQP2-F204V Rescue in Heterozygous Mouse Collecting Ducts and in Cotransfected MDCK Cells

(A) In heterozygous animals, AQP2 localizes and responds to dDAVP normally.(B) Mutant and wild-type AQP2 physically interact.To generate GFP fusions of AQP2, the pCMV⋅SPORT6 AQP2 construct was used in a PCR reaction with the primers Sp6 and 5′-GACTGGATCCCGGCCTTGCTGCCGCGCGGCAG-3′ to remove the stop codon of AQP2.In support of this, AQP2-F204V can interact with wild-type AQP2 (Figure 5B), and when coexpressed with wild-type protein, AQP2-F204V can reach the cell surface (Figure 5C bottom right panel and 5D).In a forward genetic screen, a mouse with an Aqp2 mutation was identified.Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin, these results indicate that AQP2-F204V is transported to the cell surface when wild-type AQP2 is present, but not on its own.All exons of Aqp2 were amplified from mouse genomic DNA and sequenced.Rather, the perinuclear staining is consistent with an ER localization of mutant AQP2.On top of these, we transiently transfected AQP2-GFP or AQP2-F204V-GFP expression constructs.Sequencing of Aqp2 and genotyping of mice.(D) Mutant AQP2 is present at the cell surface in cells coexpressing wild-type AQP2 (AQP2-WT).(C) Wild-type AQP2 rescues the localization defect of mutant AQP2.We now report a novel F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene.Colocalization of calnexin with AQP2 was investigated directly, and it was found that 80% of all AQP2-F204V protein colocalized with calnexin.Stable cell lines expressing mouse wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-F204V were established.MDCK cells stably expressing wild-type AQP2 were transiently transfected with GFP tagged wild-type AQP2, AQP2-F204V, or GFP alone.Generally, the localization of AQP2-F204V-GFP was clearly more apical when wild-type AQP2 was also expressed.The perinuclear distribution of AQP2-F204V is consistent with an ER compartmentalization.The next two show expression of both the stable wild-type AQP2 and the transient AQP2-F204V-GFP.The boxed residue indicates phenylalanine at position 204.

AQP2-F204V Rescue in Heterozygous Mouse Collecting Ducts and in Cotransfected MDCK Cells

(A) In heterozygous animals, AQP2 localizes and responds to dDAVP normally.(B) Mutant and wild-type AQP2 physically interact.To generate GFP fusions of AQP2, the pCMV⋅SPORT6 AQP2 construct was used in a PCR reaction with the primers Sp6 and 5′-GACTGGATCCCGGCCTTGCTGCCGCGCGGCAG-3′ to remove the stop codon of AQP2.In support of this, AQP2-F204V can interact with wild-type AQP2 (Figure 5B), and when coexpressed with wild-type protein, AQP2-F204V can reach the cell surface (Figure 5C bottom right panel and 5D).In a forward genetic screen, a mouse with an Aqp2 mutation was identified.Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin, these results indicate that AQP2-F204V is transported to the cell surface when wild-type AQP2 is present, but not on its own.All exons of Aqp2 were amplified from mouse genomic DNA and sequenced.Rather, the perinuclear staining is consistent with an ER localization of mutant AQP2.To test the idea that AQP2-F204V localizes to the ER, we co-stained cells transfected with Aqp2F204V (cDNA) for AQP2 and an ER marker, calnexin (Figure 4C).The remaining 20% appeared at the periphery of the ER, representing AQP2-F204V that had potentially progressed beyond the ER.Total membranes and immunoprecipitates (GFP-IP) were Western blotted using an antibody against AQP2 (arrow) or AQP2-GFP fusions (arrowhead).AQP2 translocated completely to the apical cell surface upon dDAVP stimulation.Cells were stimulated with forskolin, and cell surface biotinylated proteins were precipitated then analyzed for the presence of wild-type AQP2 (arrow) and AQP2-F204V (arrowhead) by Western blot.Curiously, AQP2-T126M does localize properly in at least a subset of cells.Note that mutant AQP2 is not properly localized to the subapical compartment, nor does it respond to dDAVP.The T126M knock-in clearly shows that Aqp2 is an essential gene [18].Total cells and the biotinylated precipitates were immunoblotting using an antibody to AQP2.GFP fusions of either wild-type AQP2 (WT-GFP, top photomicrographs) or F204V AQP2 (F204V-GFP, bottom photomicrographs) were expressed in polarized MDCK stable cell lines expressing vector alone (vector, left photomicrographs) or AQP2-WT (right photomicrographs).Unlike all other family members, AQP2 is not constitutively inserted into the plasma membrane.Mutant AQP2 fails to localize to the cell surface upon forskolin stimulation.Congenital NDI is caused by mutations in either the water channel, AQP2, or in the receptor, AVPR2.Although it has been demonstrated that a recessive allele (encoding AQP2-R187C) of NDI fails to interact with wild-type AQP2 [6], here we show that AQP2-F204V does interact with the wild-type protein, presumably as part of heterotetramers, and represents a rescuable allele, both in vitro and in vivo.It has also been shown that wild-type AQP2 protein can rescue a translocation-defective mutant protein, AQP2-P262L, when the two are coexpressed in MDCK cells [25].In an attempt to recapitulate human NDI, mice have been generated with mutations in Aqp2 and Avpr2 [15,18].Yang and colleagues created a mouse with a T126M knock-in mutation in the Aqp2 gene.AQP2 was detected using goat anti-AQP2 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; #sc-9882) and a 1:200 dilution of AlexaFluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody.When expressed in wild-type AQP2 cells, however, AQP2-F204V-GFP localized to the apical surface to varying degrees (Figure 5C, lower right images [i–iii]).Although the effect was subtle in cell (iii), AQP2-F204V-GFP was partly localized to the apical surface.AQP2-F204V, on the other hand, appeared in a punctate but perinuclear pattern (Figure 4B, third column).Cells expressing AQP2-F204V lacked the 35–45 kDa form and were enriched in the core-glycosylated 31 kDa form.The IMAGE (http://image.llnl.gov) accession number of AQP2 is 4222942.Kidneys sections were immunostained for AQP2 (red) and the basolateral marker AQP3 (green).MDCK stable cell lines expressing vector alone, wild-type AQP2, or AQP2-F204V (and in some cases transiently expressing a GFP construct) were grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips until tight junctions formed.Immunostaining of kidney shows that AQP2-F204V does not efficiently transport water, because it fails to localize to the apical cell surface after dDAVP treatment.Reduced efficiency in exiting the ER may explain why AQP2-F204V is enriched in the 31 kDa high-mannose glycosylated form.In experiments in which GFP fusions were used, AQP2 was probed using the antibody combination used for kidney immunohistochemistry in order to detect the AQP2 at 594 nm, to distinguish between the GFP fusion proteins.(B) Amino acid conservation of mouse AQP2 (residues 194–214).Colocalization of AQP2-F204V with the ER protein calnexin in transfected MDCK cells shows that, while most of the mutant protein is trapped in the ER, some does progress beyond the ER.Therefore, kidneys from heterozygous animals were examined for evidence of two populations of AQP2 protein.AQP2-F204V-GFP is expressed approximately equally in both cell lines (Figure 5D, total cells), but is biotinylated only when wild-type AQP2 is also expressed (Figure 5D, surface biotinylated).

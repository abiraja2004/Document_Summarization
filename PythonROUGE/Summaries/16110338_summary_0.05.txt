All of these genes show marked derepression in the rd7 retina.Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S-cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse rd7 mutant.[19] reported that M-opsin expression is mildly increased in the rd7 mutant retina.All of the genes show marked up-regulation in the rd7 mutant.There is no change in the number of M-opsin– or Thrb2-positive cells in the rd7 mutant.The increased expression of Gckr in rd7 mutant retina suggests that it too may be a cone-enriched gene.It is possible that in the rd7 mutant retina, there is a short delay in the relocation of the M-opsin–expressing cone cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL.Figure 2

The upper sets of photomicrographs demonstrate examples of type I and type II cone gene derepression in the rd7 mutant retina as explained in the main text.This gene showed a unique pattern of expression in the adult rd7 mutant retina.Novel Cone-Specific Genes Are Derepressed in rd7

Given that the majority of known cone-specific genes showed marked derepression in the rd7 mutant, additional candidate genes up-regulated on microarray analysis were evaluated for cone-specific expression.All of these genes show marked derepression in the rd7 retina.Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S-cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse rd7 mutant.[19] reported that M-opsin expression is mildly increased in the rd7 mutant retina.All of the genes show marked up-regulation in the rd7 mutant.There is no change in the number of M-opsin– or Thrb2-positive cells in the rd7 mutant.The increased expression of Gckr in rd7 mutant retina suggests that it too may be a cone-enriched gene.It is possible that in the rd7 mutant retina, there is a short delay in the relocation of the M-opsin–expressing cone cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL.Figure 2

Cone-Specific and Cone-Enriched Genes Evaluated in the rd7 Mutant by Microarray and In Situ Hybridization

This table is a supplemental version of Figure 1.In addition, two groups recently reported derepression of additional cone genes in the rd7 mutant [18,19].Table S2

Rod Genes Evaluated in the rd7 Mutant by In Situ Hybridization

This table contains details about the in situ hybridization patterns of 22 genes (many of which are rod-specific) evaluated in the rd7 mutant retina.Strikingly, the majority of the photoreceptors in the rd7 retina represent a morphologically hybrid cell type that expresses both rod- and cone-specific genes.This latter finding suggests that all the rod- and many cone-specific genes are coexpressed in the majority of photoreceptors in the rd7 mutant.Rod Genes Are Only Modestly and Temporarily Affected in rd7

In sharp contrast to changes in cone gene expression, rod-specific genes were much less severely affected in the rd7 mutant.Two Distinct Patterns of Cone Gene Derepression in rd7

In order to confirm these microarray results, an in situ hybridization analysis of the putative up-regulated cone genes was carried out in which the rd7 mutant retina was compared with age-matched, wild-type controls.This pattern of staining suggests that these genes are more highly expressed in S-opsin expressing cells than in the hybrid cells of the rd7 retina.In contrast to the rd7 mutant, Notch1−/− retinas show marked derepression of Thrb2 and a corresponding derepression of the gene that encodes M-opsin.The second pattern of derepression seen in the rd7 retina (type II), is represented by a scattered population of cells throughout the ONL that shows derepression of several cone-specific genes, including S-cone opsin.We have identified two patterns of cone gene derepression in the rd7 mutant retina, in agreement with a previous report by Chen et al.Figure 3

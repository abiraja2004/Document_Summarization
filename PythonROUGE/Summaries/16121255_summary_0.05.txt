On top of these, we transiently transfected AQP2-GFP or AQP2-F204V-GFP expression constructs.Sequencing of Aqp2 and genotyping of mice.(D) Mutant AQP2 is present at the cell surface in cells coexpressing wild-type AQP2 (AQP2-WT).(C) Wild-type AQP2 rescues the localization defect of mutant AQP2.We now report a novel F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene.Colocalization of calnexin with AQP2 was investigated directly, and it was found that 80% of all AQP2-F204V protein colocalized with calnexin.Stable cell lines expressing mouse wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-F204V were established.MDCK cells stably expressing wild-type AQP2 were transiently transfected with GFP tagged wild-type AQP2, AQP2-F204V, or GFP alone.Generally, the localization of AQP2-F204V-GFP was clearly more apical when wild-type AQP2 was also expressed.The perinuclear distribution of AQP2-F204V is consistent with an ER compartmentalization.On top of these, we transiently transfected AQP2-GFP or AQP2-F204V-GFP expression constructs.Sequencing of Aqp2 and genotyping of mice.(D) Mutant AQP2 is present at the cell surface in cells coexpressing wild-type AQP2 (AQP2-WT).(C) Wild-type AQP2 rescues the localization defect of mutant AQP2.We now report a novel F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene.Colocalization of calnexin with AQP2 was investigated directly, and it was found that 80% of all AQP2-F204V protein colocalized with calnexin.Stable cell lines expressing mouse wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-F204V were established.MDCK cells stably expressing wild-type AQP2 were transiently transfected with GFP tagged wild-type AQP2, AQP2-F204V, or GFP alone.Generally, the localization of AQP2-F204V-GFP was clearly more apical when wild-type AQP2 was also expressed.The perinuclear distribution of AQP2-F204V is consistent with an ER compartmentalization.The next two show expression of both the stable wild-type AQP2 and the transient AQP2-F204V-GFP.The boxed residue indicates phenylalanine at position 204.

hAQP2, human AQP2; mAQP1, mouse AQP1; mAQP2, mouse AQP2; rAQP2, rat AQP2; xAQP2, Xenopus AQP2.GFP fused to AQP2-F204V was expressed in MDCK cells expressing wild-type AQP2 or vector alone.In humans, NDI is caused by mutations in Avpr2 or Aqp2.Knockout of the mouse Aqp2 gene has not been reported.
